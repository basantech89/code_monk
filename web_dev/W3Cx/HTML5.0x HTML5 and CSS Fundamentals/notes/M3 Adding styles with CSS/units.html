    <p>
        CSS properties expect some sort of dimension value. Dimension values support a wide
        variety of units. But the most common and useful ones are: px, em, rem, %, vh and vw
    </p>

    <h2> px </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 'px' is short for 'pixel', which is a single dot on the screen </li>
        <li>
            Text with  <code> font-size:20px </code> is 20 pixels tall on-screen.
            In actuality, due to browser zooming, retina displays, or other factors, this may or
            may not match to 20 physical on-screen pixels.
        </li>
        <li> px are useful for both horizontal and vertical dimensions.  </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> em </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            'em' is a typographic term that has come to the Web. On the Web, em units are usually
            used for vertical dimensions.
        </li>
        <li> One 'em' maps to the height of one capital letter in the parent context. </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
li { font-size: 0.9em; }  /* text in a list item is smaller than its parents */
h1 { font-size: 1.2em; }  /* but an h1 will be bigger than the parent */
i  { font-size: 0.5em; }  /* and any italicized text will be half as big. */
    </pre>

    <h2> rem </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            rem' is much like 'em', except that 'em' sizes an element relative to its parent,
            and 'rem' always derives its size relative to the root.
        </li>
        <li>
            In an HTML document with lots of nested elements, 'rem' will generally prove to be
            more reliable than 'em'. 'rem' is supported in all modern day browsers,
            including mobile, but not older ones.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> % </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Whereas em is a measure relative to the parents text size, the percentage unit (%) is
            relative to the parent dimension.
        </li>
        <li>
            This is a useful unit for both horizontal and vertical dimensions, though often more
            useful in the horizontal.
        </li>
        <li>
            One of the limitations of this rule is that for it to work correctly, the parent must
            have an explicit width or height set. This limitation is particularly noticeable in the
            vertical dimension. If the parent element doesn't have an explicit height set then
            child percentages may be percentages of 0.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
p {
    margin-left:  10%;
    margin-right: 10%;  /* 10% of parent width will be spent on the two side margins */
}
    </pre>

    <h2> vh (viewport height) / vw (viewport width) </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The vh and vw units work much like the percentage ( % ) unit. But instead of percentage
            of the parent, it is percentage of the screen (aka viewport).
        </li>
        <li>
            vh and vw do not suffer the parent limitation that the % unit does.  Most modern
            browsers support these units, but there are some exceptions on older mobile browsers.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
p {
  margin-left:  10vw;
  margin-right: 10vw;  /* 10% of screen width will be spent on the two side margins */
}
    </pre>
