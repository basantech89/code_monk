        <h2> Inheritance </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Most CSS rules once applied to an element are also applied to all the children of that
                element, and to their children, and theirs ad infinitum. There are exceptions, notably
                the layout properties (margin, padding, position, width, etc.) and the decorative
                properties (border, background, etc.) do not cascade.
                This cascading of a CSS property from parent to child is also called "inheritance".
            </li>
            <li>
                Inheritance can be explicitly leveraged. Many CSS properties accept the value of inherit,
                which means to inherit the value from the parent. By smartly leveraging inherit, you can
                reduce repetition in your CSS rules and make your project easier to maintain.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is no reliable rule for which CSS properties are inheritable by default and which
                are not. However, generally, the properties associated with positioning and layout are
                not inherited.  Likewise, the decorative properties (borders, background images, etc.)
                do not inherit.  Most properties that begin with text- or font- inherit.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Precedence </h2>
        <p>
            CSS precedence comes into play when there are different rules competing to set different
            values for the same property. When rendering CSS, the browser has some guidelines it
            follows for resolving conflicting rules. Here is rough summary, in order
        </p>
        <h3> Most Specific Rule </h3>
        <p>
            A more specific rule takes precedence over a less specific rule.  A rule that more
            tightly matches a particular element than a general rule will be applied.
        </p>
        <pre>
span { color: blue; }
ul li span { color: red; }
        </pre>
        <p>
            In the example above, both rules are attempting to set a span color for a span inside
            a list item. However, the second rule will "win" when there is a conflict
        </p>

        <h3> #id selector is the most specific </h3>
        <p> Rules with an id selector (e.g.  #someid ) are considered more specific than rules
            without.
        </p>

        <h3> .class selector is more specific than a tag selector </h3>
        <p>
            Rules employing a class selector (e.g. .someclass ) are considered more specific than
            rules without (but not as specific as an #id selector, which trumps everything).
        </p>

        <h3> Rules that come later override those that come earlier </h3>
        <pre>
.hortense { color: red; text-decoration: underline; }
.hortense { color: blue; }
        </pre>
        <p>
            In the example above, an element with the .hortense class will be underlined and its
            color will be blue, because that rule came later than when it was set red.
        </p>

        <h3> !important </h3>
        <code> p { color: orange !important; } </code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Because multiple CSS selectors can resolve to the same element, and because the rules
                that govern precedence are complex, you may from time to time encounter a situation
                where you need to apply a particular CSS property and you want it to take precedence
                over all others, no matter what. !important will do that.
            </li>
            <li>
                This may seem like an attractive option, but using it is not recommended. Once you
                start to use it, then you'll eventually run into a conflict with the various rules
                that are using !important, and from that conflict there is no escape.  If you are
                having problems with precedence the best advice is to fix them directly, rather than
                using !important.
