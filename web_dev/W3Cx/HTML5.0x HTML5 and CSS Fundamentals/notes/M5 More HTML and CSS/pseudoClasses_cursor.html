        <h1> Refined CSS selectors - pseudo classes </h1>
        <p>
            Pseudo Classes allow us to apply styles to the different states of an element.
            Or to various children of an element based on their index, or to other interactions
            with the browser
        </p>
        <code> a:visited { color: purple; } </code>
        <p>
            Above us we see a tag selector (a) followed by a pseudo class, which consists of a colon
            and a word (e.g. :visited ). This particular CSS rule will be applied to any a tag that
            the user has already visited. There can be no spaces on either side of the colon.
            Pseudo classes can be amended onto any CSS selector, not just tag selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            a full list of pseudo classes can be found
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes" target="_blank"> here </a>
        </p>

        <h2> :visited </h2>
        <p>
            The :visited pseudo class is usually put on a selector that resolves to an &lt;a&gt; tag.
            It enables you to define a style for the visited state of the link. For example, if the
            user has already been to that Web site, the :visited style will be applied.
        </p>

        <h2> :hover / :active </h2>
        <ul class="style-list">
            <li>
                The :hover pseudo class lets you change the style for an element when the mouse is
                hovering above it.  The :active pseudo class is applied when the mouse is depressed
                into its area
            </li>
            <li>
                Note that the mouse is rarely hovering or clicking over/into "just one" item.
                At any given moment, the mouse is usually over several elements, because if it is
                over a child element, it will be over the parent, grandparent, and great grandparent.  Therefore, if you have two different style rules, such as li:hover and ul:hover, then they will both be activated,  when the mouse is over one of the list items
            </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
            li:hover  { background-color: red; }
            li:active { background-color: green; }
            ul:active { border: 1px solid pink; }
        </pre>

        <h2> :nth-child </h2>
        <pre>
            tr:nth-child(odd)  { background-color: lightgray; }
            tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: white; }
        </pre>
        <p>
            The :nth-child pseudo class is very handy.  Unlike the pseudo classes we've seen so far,
            it expects a parameter. The pseudo class always ends with a pair of parentheses with an
            expression inside. This expression is simply the term odd or even, however, there are
            other more advanced possibilities with mathematical equations containing the term  n.

        <h1> Cursor property </h1>
        <code> li { cursor: pointer; } </code>
        <ul class="style-list">
            <li>
                The cursor CSS property lets you change the cursor that is displayed when the mouse
                is over the element in question. This does not have to be relegated to a :hover
                style, it can be applied anywhere. Though, if you want to change the cursor when an
                element is depressed,  set the cursor property in the context of an :active style.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are many possible values for the cursor property.  Their exact representation
                may vary slightly from browser to browser.  Common values include: default, pointer,
                text, move and grab.  (Hover over each value to see). In addition, some browsers
                support a custom image as well
            </li>
        </ul>
        <code> ( cursor: url("images/my_pointer.png"); ) </code>
