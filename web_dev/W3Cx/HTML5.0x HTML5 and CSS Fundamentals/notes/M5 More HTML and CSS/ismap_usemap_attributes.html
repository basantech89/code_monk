    <h1> 5.3.2 - The ismap and usemap attributes </h1>
    <p>
        The ismap and usemap are image attributes, adding the ismap or usemap attributes to the
        &lt;img&gt; tag means that the picture is an image with clickable areas. Imagine a
        picture of a world map where different countries on the map can be clicked and it
        navigates to another page like the country's wikipedia page. Simply put, we say such an
        image is mapped

            <h2> The ismap attribute </h2>
            <ul class="style-list">
                <li>
                    ismap is a boolean attribute i.e. its value is either true or false. Thus, just the
                    presence of the attribute indicates that it is a mapped image. To be more precise,
                    we say it is a server-side image-map.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We need to create a map file with these details and then add the location of this
                    map file using the anchor element. Here is a code sample:
                </li>
            </ul>
            <textarea title="ismap-example" disabled rows="4" cols="60">
                <a href="ismap-images/ismap.cgi" target="_self">
                    <img src="images/logo.png" alt="ismap tutorial" ismap>
                </a>
            </textarea>
            <ul class="style-list">
                <li> Here, the href attribute points to the location of the map file </li>
                <li>
                    ismap only works if the &lt;img&gt; tag is used within the anchor element like in
                    the code above. This is important because without a link to the target map file,
                    it has no idea what to do with your ismap specification
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2> The usemap attribute </h2>
            <p>
                usemap is a lot like ismap and is more widely used. ismap deals with server-side
                image-maps whereas usemap deals with client-side image-maps
            </p>
            <ul class="style-list">
                <li>
                    Server-side image-maps: use separate map files that have to be downloaded.
                    They depend on the server for translating the request. They also create
                    additional network traffic
                </li>
                <li>
                    Client-side image-maps: reside within an HTML document. The browser takes care of
                    the translation (translating mouse coordinates clicked to corresponding Web pages)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Client-side maps are becoming increasingly popular. usemap is NOT of type boolean.
                    It takes in the name of the map with a '#' character preceding it
                </li>
                <li>
                    Like ismap, usemap cannot be used by itself. In ismap, we used the anchor tag to
                    specify the map file. In usemap, we use the &lt;area&gt; element as a child of
                    &lt;map&gt; element to specify the coordinates and the page it should navigate to.
                    The usemap value should match the map element's name or id attribute
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <span class="bold"> map </span> - defines a client-side image map and is used to
                create a relationship between the image and the map by matching the map name and
                usemap's value. It contains a set of area elements
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold"> area </span> - defines the areas that can be clicked and the
                pages it should navigate to. Typically takes the shape of the area, coordinates of
                the area, URL of the page it should redirect to and the alt attribute
            </p>
            <p> The shape attribute in the &lt;area&gt; tag has four values </p>
            <ul class="style-list">
                <li>
                    circle - The clickable area is a circle. You need to specify three coordinates.
                    E.g. coords="89,52,6". The first two is the coordinate center of the circle and
                    the last is the radius
                </li>
                <li>
                    rect - The clickable area is a rectangle. You need to specify four coordinates.
                    E.g. coords="0,0,195,439". This is the x & y coordinates of the top left corner
                    and the x & y coordinates of the bottom right corner
                </li>
                <li>
                    poly - The clickable area is a polygon of any number of sides. This shape is very
                    flexible and takes as many pairs of coordinates as you need to form your polygon.
                    E.g. coords="277,85,322,87,275,173,269,138". The last set of coordinates can match
                    the first set. If it doesn't, the browser will automatically match it for you to
                    close the polygon.
                </li>
                <li> default - The clickable area is the whole image </li>
            </ul>
