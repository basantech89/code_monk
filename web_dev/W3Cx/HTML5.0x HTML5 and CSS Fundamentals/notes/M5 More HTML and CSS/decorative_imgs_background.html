    <h1> 5.4.1 Decorative images and backgrounds </h1>
    <p> Decorative images are incorporated via CSS </p>

    <section>
        <h2> background-color </h2>
        <p> In addition to the values of transparent and none, there are all the values of  that we saw applicable to the color property </p>
        <h2> background-image </h2>
        <code> div { background-image: url("images/kitten.png"); } </code>
        <p>
            As these are decorative images, there are quite a few different usage scenarios that can leverage background images. For instance,
            an image can be used as repeating tile, or a background image can fit its parent element, or be a large panoramic image not fully
            viewed.  These scenarios can be constructed with other CSS properties, like background-repeat, background-size, and
            background-attach (as well as several others)
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> background-repeat </h2>
        <ul class="style-list">
            <li>
                By default, if the rectangular area of an element is bigger than the image itself, then the image will repeat and fill the space, like tiles
            </li>
            <li>
                The background-repeat property can be used to control this. It's more commonly used values are: repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y,
                and no-repeat. The no-repeat value is very useful, and bears repeating
            </li>
            <li>
                There are advanced uses of this property.  Notice in the above example, that if the size of the parent element is not exactly
                a multiple of the tile, then the image may be "cropped" and bleed off the side.  That can be managed by centering the
                tile (with background-position: center;)
            </li>
            <li>
                Additionally the background-repeat property can also be used to control how it repeats. The space value will result in cropped
                images; it means "repeat, and add space between the elements so there is no cropping". Note that this property does not let
                you directly manipulate the amount of spacing. That is calculated for you.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> background-size </h2>
        <p>
            When not repeating, it is very useful to size a background image to fit its element. The background-size can be used for this.
            There are two very useful values:  contain and cover.
        </p>
        <ul class="style-list">
            <li>
                The contain value will put the entire image into the space of the element, however, the space of the element may not be
                completely filled if the aspect ratio of the element and the image do not match
            </li>
            <li>
                The cover value is the opposite. It will completely fill the element but the image may be cropped off two opposite sides.
                Neither contain or cover will distort or squish the image.  Its aspect ratio is maintained
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The background-size property can also be used to more exactly size the image.  When used in this fashion,
            it takes two values separated by a space. The first governs the width, the second the height.  Examples:
        </p>
        <pre>
    .kittens  { background-size: 100px 120px; } /* might distort */
    .puppies  { background-size: 100px auto; }  /* auto preserves aspect ratio, no distorting */
    .munchies { background-size: 50% auto; }    /* % is of percentage of parent (not of image). */
        </pre>
        <p> Note that units (rem, vh, etc.) except px and % have no guarantee of support </p>
        <p>
            When specifying exact sizes, the auto value is extremely useful. It allows you to worry only about one dimension,
            and then the other will handle it for you. Otherwise there is a risk of stretching/distorting images.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2> background-position </h2>
        <p>
            Like background-size, background-position can be used to place or offset a background image in the element.
            It takes two values (x and y) separated by a space when used to exactly specify a position
        </p>
        <p>
            The most useful is the center value.  It is position the center of the image in the center of the element.
            This is useful even with repeating tiles
        </p>
