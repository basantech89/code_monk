    <p>
        As you start to leverage borders, background colors, and the other decorative CSS
        properties we have seen in the previous sections you will need to become more aware
        of the element size and how to manage it
    </p>
    <h2> The wrong way </h2>
    <p>
        A common trap that newbies fall into is to discover the width, height, left and top CSS
        properties and to start blindly using them
    </p>
    <p>
        These are useful properties, however, they should not be your first choice. These CSS
        properties depend upon other properties before they can even be used, and they can have
        unintended consequences. We'll explore them more in next module when covering Layout
    </p>

    <h2> Padding - the right way </h2>
    <ul class="style-list">
        <li>
            The best way to control an element's size for the purpose of controlling how a border or
            background extends relative to the item itself is with the padding properties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Padding is a way of making an element a little bigger than it would normally be,
            negative values are not allowed
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> can be abbreviated </p>
    <pre>
padding: &lt;top&gt; &lt;right&gt; &lt;bottom&gt; &lt;left&gt;;
padding: &lt;top and bottom&gt; &lt;right and left&gt;;
padding: &lt;all&gt;;
    </pre>
    <p>
        When decorative CSS is not used by many CSS newbies, use padding like margin, to space
        things out. Note: That is not correct. Margins make space between elements and padding
        makes an element larger
    </p>

    <p> <mark>
        This section has been about the decorative CSS properties, like borders, background colors,
        background images, and shadows. In the context of these things users often want to make an
        element "bigger", or keep the border a bit away. And in this context the padding property
        is absolutely the correct property that should be used to increase the elements size.
        Do not use the width or height properties for this
    </mark> </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, there are other issues associated with the width and height properties.
        We will discuss these in-depth in the next module. Here is a quick rundown
    </p>
    <ul class="style-list">
        <li> height and width properties do not work on inline elements </li>
        <li>
            Many elements have natural behaviors that occur when height and width are not set.
            These are generally advantageous. However, by setting the width and height you lose
            those advantages. We'll understand this in next module
        </li>
        <li>
            Most Web pages are viewed in a variety of browser sizes, especially on mobile devices
            like phones or tablets. Overuse of explicit width and height can make your page
            unviewable on smaller devices
        </li>
        <li>
            The flexbox layout system (which we will see next) is incredibly powerful, but by
            over-determining explicit heights and widths you reduce its usefulness to you and your viewer
        </li>
    </ul>
