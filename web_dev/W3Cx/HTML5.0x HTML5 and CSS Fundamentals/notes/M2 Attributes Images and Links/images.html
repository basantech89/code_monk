    <h2> Introduction to Images </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Search engines do not 'see' images.
            They rely on the alt attribute to find out what the image is about.
            If you use your target keyword in alt, it will optimize the search.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the image is purely for presentation or decoration purposes,
            you should leave alt empty -   <xmp> <img alt=""> </xmp>
            Assistive technology will then ignore this content.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Example </h3>
    <xmp> <img src="images/html5.png"
               alt="HTML resized image"
               title="Resized image seems to fit the page better"
               height="173">
    </xmp>

    <h2> Width and Height Attribute </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You don't need to define both width and height.
            You can just specify either height or width and the aspect ratio will be adjusted.
        </li>
        <li>
            The use of these attributes really depends on how you are using the image.
            If it is part of an image grid or a list with multiple images of the same size,
            it is best achieved by CSS. So you don't have to bother adding the same dimensions
            to every image and it will be repetitive. Plus it is generally bad practice to
            encode dimensions directly into the HTML.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, if you are adding the image into some content and it needs to be a certain size
            for the visual flow of the reader, then it is best to add it to HTML using the
            height and width attributes. This is to avoid cluttering your CSS with a style
            for every image in your page. This is also useful if you are changing or removing
            the image: you can just remove it from your HTML and not deal with remembering to
            remove it from your CSS too.
