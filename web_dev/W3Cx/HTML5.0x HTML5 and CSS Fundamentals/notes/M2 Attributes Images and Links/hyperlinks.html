<section>
    <h2> Why you should use text over image links </h2>
    <p> When it comes to hyperlinks, try to use text instead of images when possible. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Images are not as well understood or recognized as text. </li>
        <li> Text is better for accessibility. </li>
        <li> If you have text in an image, search engines do not recognize text in images. </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="best_practices">
    <h2> Best Practices </h2>
    <p>
        If you choose to have image links, it should have alternate text
        that describes the purpose of the link instead of the image used - describe the target link.

<section id="states">
    <h2> States of a Hyperlink </h2>
    <p>
        If the link has not been clicked, it will be blue and underlined.
        Now, click on the link and you will see that a visited link looks purple and underlined.
        Apart from unvisited and visited links, there is also a status called active link.
        A link becomes active while the user is clicking on it.
        During this time, the link will be red and underlined.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Unvisited: blue + underlined </li>
        <li> Visited: purple + underlined </li>
        <li> Active: red + underlined </li>
    </ul>

<section id="usage">
    <h2> Usage </h2>
        <p> Text in a hyperlink </p>
        <xmp> <a href="https://www.qwant.com/"> If you click on me, I will take you to qwant.com </a> </xmp>
        <p> Paragraph in a hyperlink </p>
        <xmp> <a href="https://www.qwant.com/"> <p> If you click on me, I will take you to qwant.com </p> </a> </xmp>
        <p> Image in a hyperlink </p>
        <xmp> <a href="https://www.qwant.com/"> <img src="images/qwant-image.png" alt="Image navigating to Qwant"> </a> </xmp>
        <p>
            You can even use the anchor element to add your email address with protocol
            such as "mailto" under the contacts section of your Web page.
        </p>
        <xmp> <p>Feedback: <a href="mailto:authors@example.com">Send Mail to Authors </a> </p> </xmp>
        <p> You can add a subject to the email. </p>
        <xmp> <p> Feedback: <a href="mailto:authors@example.com?Subject=Hello">Send Mail to Authors with Subject </a> </p> </xmp>
        <p> Nevertheless, you should probably avoid using hyperlinks for email addresses: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The email address usually opens up on the default email client on the
                user's computer which they might not use. This defeats the whole purpose
            </li>
            <li>
                Providing your email address in your Web page directly as text or a hyperlink
                will expose your email address. Bots or spam crawlers can be used to search
                the Web to pick up email addresses for spam. You should avoid this if possible
                and use contact forms instead.
            </li>

    <h2> Attributes for Hyperlinks </h2>
    <section id="target_attr">
        <h3> Target Attribute </h3>
        <p>
            Target specifies the destination where the linked URL in href should be opened.
            It can take a variety of different values, but for our purposes we'll focus on the two below.
        </p>
        <textarea disabled rows="5" cols="150">
        Destination                            Attribute Value                              Example
In the same window,                             _self                   <a href="second.html" target="_self"> another page </a>
default behaviour if no target is specified

In a new window or tab                          _blank                  <a href="second.html" target="_blank"> another page </a>
        </textarea>
    </section>
    <section id="media_attr">
        <h3> Media Attribute </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The media attribute was introduced in HTML5. It is used to specify what kind of
                media or device the URL you linked to in href is optimized for. The URL could be
                targeted for special devices like projectors, speech synthesizers or pages meant
                to be printed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Imagine you have a page scattered with multiple images and you want to display this
                page on a handheld device. Handheld devices are known to have small screens and
                limited bandwidth. We want to align the page better for a small screen and reduce
                the size of images. So the media attribute allows us to tell the anchor element that
                this page is targeted for handheld devices. You do this by providing a value for the
                attribute. This value could be any valid media query and is a combination of device
                type and media rendering values.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You could create a print link to a long content heavy page that will redirect you to a
            print version of the same. You want this print version to be formatted into one page
            ideal for printing and with resolution of 250 dpi. Here is how the HTML5 code will look
            like:
        </p>
        <textarea disabled rows="4" cols="80">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries?output=print"
media="print and (resolution:250dpi)"> Print wiki page about media queries
</a>
        </textarea>
    </section>
    <section id="download_attr">
        <h3> Download Attribute </h3>
        <p>
            The download attribute is also new in HTML5 and it makes a link download a file
            instead of navigate to another location. It takes in the filename as value but the
            value is optional. So the download attribute can be specified in the following ways:
        </p>
        <textarea disabled rows="3" cols="90">
<a href="/assets/hello.txt" download> download hello.txt </a>
<a href="/assets/hello.txt" download="new-name"> download new-name.txt </a>
        </textarea>
        <p> <mark> Download attribute will only works on Chrome, Firefox and Opera </mark> </p>
