    <h2> Div Element </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The &lt;div&gt; tag is one you will likely see sprinkled all over an HTML document.
            It is used to define a division or a section of the document.
            Div is not a semantic element, however, it is commonly used when there isn't a better
            semantic assignment for it.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is like a generic container that can hold a variety of elements such as
            paragraphs, images, links, tables, etc. It can be used to group elements for
            styling purposes. If you want to style all code snippets in your HTML document
            a certain way, you can place your code in a div container and apply styles
            collectively to it using the class attribute.
        </li>
        <li>
            It should only be used if you cannot use any other semantic element in its place
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Span Element </h2>
    <p> When span element can be used </p>
    <ul>
        <li> To add styling to part of a sentence (inline) </li>
        <li> Manipulate part of a sentence using JavaScript </li>
        <li>
            When no other HTML element is applicable, you can use
            &lt;span&gt; (and &lt;div&gt;) to add attributes such as class and id
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt; is not a semantic element. You should only use &lt;span&gt; 
        if no other semantic element is appropriate. &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; serve the same
        purpose but should be applied at different levels. &lt;div&gt; is a block level element
        (for a block of space) while &lt;span&gt; is an inline element (for within a line or phrase).
    </p>

<section>
    <h2> Difference between div and span </h2>
    <p> 
        They are both considered generic elements that don't have any meaning.
        But &lt;div&gt; is a block level element while &lt;span&gt; is an inline element.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold"> Block Level Elements </span> - Used within body of the page. It
        occupies a block of space and starts in a new line. It usually has an empty line above
        and below the block. They can contain inline elements and other block level elements.
        Other examples: &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold"> Inline Elements </span> - As the name suggests are 'in-the-line'.
        They can start anywhere in a line. They can only contain data (like text) or other
        in-line elements. Other examples: &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;.
    </p>
    <p> <mark>
        After an opening tag &lt;p&gt;, if it sees another &lt;p&gt; or any other
        block level element including &lt;div&gt;, it will automatically close the
        first open &lt;p&gt; for you. Nesting one paragraph tag in another is not valid because
        the browser will consider them as two paragraphs one after the other. Even though you
        close the paragraphs with two closing tags &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; at the end,
        they are ignored as errors.
