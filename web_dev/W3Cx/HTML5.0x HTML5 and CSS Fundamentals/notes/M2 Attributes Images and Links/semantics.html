Tag             Type            Description
&lt;b&gt;             Style           HTML 4 - Makes text bold
&lt;b&gt;             Semantic        HTML 5 - keywords in a document, product names, action words without making them important, headings in list items
&lt;i&gt;             Style           HTML 4 - Makes text italics
&lt;i&gt;             Semantic        HTML 5 - for text in a different mood or voice, such as foreign words, a thought or technical terms.
&lt;em&gt;            Semantic        Emphasizes text - italics, As of HTML5, &lt;em&gt; is also used for words and sentences you would pronounce differently
&lt;strong&gt;        Semantic        Important text - bold

&lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; may not produce appropriate styling for some parts of the world like China and Japan
If you do use &lt;b&gt; or &lt;i&gt; tags, HTML5 specification recommends that you also use class attributes to identify the semantic intention of the markup.

    <h3>What is the Markup Validator and what does it do?</h3>
    <p> The Markup Validator is a free tool and service that
<a href="https://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#validation_basics">validates markup</a>: in other words, it checks the syntax of Web documents, written in formats such as HTML. </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Why validate?</h3>
    <p> One of the important maxims of computer programming is: "Be conservative in what you produce; be liberal in what you accept."

Browsers follow the second half of this maxim by accepting Web pages and trying to display them even if they're not legal HTML. The problem is that different browsers (or even different versions of the same browser) will make different guesses about the same illegal construct...

  </section>
  <article>
    <h3>How do I use the Markup validator?</h3>
    <p>Most probably, you will want to use the online Markup Validation service. The simple way to use this service to validate a Web page is to paste its address into the
<a href="https://validator.w3.org/#uri">text area</a>
on the
<a href="https://validator.w3.org/">validator's home page</a>
, and press the "Check" button.</p>
  </article>
  <aside>
    <h3>Many error messages? Don't panic.</h3>
    <p> Don't panic. Did The Validator complain about your DOCTYPE declaration (or lack thereof)? Make sure your document has a syntactically correct DOCTYPE declaration, as described in the section on DOCTYPE, and make sure it correctly identifies the type of HTML you're using. Then run it through The Validator again; if you're lucky, you should get a lot fewer errors.

If this doesn't help, then you may be experiencing a cascade failure ... </p>
