        <h2> inline </h2>
        <p>
            How do you center an inline element?  As we recall, inline elements are positioned
            along the baseline, in the natural flow of the text or content. So for any individual
            inline element, there is no CSS property you can apply directly to cause this element
            to center. You may apply some padding evenly or unevenly to position its content
            relative to its own box. But that's not centering the element itself
        </p>

        <p>
            To center an inline element, we use the text-align property of its parent
            <code>
                p { text-align: center; } /* the text and any inline children of this element
                will be centered */
            </code>
        </p>

        <p>
            If this isn't satisfactory, consider changing the element to be inline-block or block.
        </p>

        <h2> block </h2>
        <p>
            How do you center a block level element? First, you may recall that block level
            elements take the width of their parent by default. If the element is the same width
            as its parent, it is already centered.  So the first step is to limit the width of
            the element.  Setting the width property directly is not generally a good practice,
            but we'll just do that and discuss sizing at length later
        </p>
        <code> div { width: 200px; }  </code>
        <p> Now that we've sized the element, how to center it? </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold"> margin magic </span> <br>
            If set to auto, then the left and right margins will center the element.  This is the
            simplest and best way of centering a block level element. So the full solution is to
            set the width and apply auto to the left and right margins (or to all margins).
        </p>
        <code> div { width: 200px; margin: auto; } </code>

        <p>
            Do auto margins seem spooky to you? There is a better way to achieve centering and
            its name is flexbox.
        </p>

        <h1> Vertical Centering </h1>

        <h2> inline </h2>
        <p>
            Inline elements respect the vertical-align property. This determines how the
            inline element is aligned relative to the baseline it is being laid upon.
            This may or may not solve your vertical centering conundrum
        </p>

        <h2> block </h2>
        <p>
            There is no margin:auto approach to vertical centering. There are some
            complicated systems that folk have developed, but the shortest and best answer
            to vertical centering: use flexbox.
