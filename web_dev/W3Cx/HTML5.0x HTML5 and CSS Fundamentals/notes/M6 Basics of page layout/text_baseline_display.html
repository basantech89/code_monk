        <h2> 6.1.1 Text baseline and the display property </h2>
        <p>
            When newbie developers are groping around CSS blindly, they often stumble upon a
            variety of CSS properties that could be used to alter the positioning or size of an
            element such as left, top, and margin. However, when using the properties, these
            developers get confused because the properties fail to behave consistently.
            Sometimes the properties work, sometimes they don't. The intrepid readers may have
            already discovered in their exercises that margin can have some unexpected behavior.
            Why is that?
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer has to do with the two CSS properties: display and position. The display
            property, in particular, has different default values for different tags. They behave
            very differently.  These two properties (display and position) often change how an
            element responds to certain other layout properties. And when this is not understood,
            then it may seem random to a developer struggling to get stuff to work
        </p>

        <h2> Baseline </h2>
        <img src="../images/baseline.png" alt="Image showing baseline" title="Image of a baseline">
        <p>
            In the image above, we see two text characters placed next to each other, the blue line
            indicating the baseline. The baseline determines how and where the characters are
            positioned. Note that the tail of the "g" hangs below the baseline
        </p>
        <p>
            The baseline is never drawn by the browser, it is not exposed directly to you as a
            developer, and CSS only may have some properties related to it. However, the baseline
            governs the placement of all inline elements.

        <h2> display: block versus inline </h2>
        <p>
            As the browser is rendering your page, every time it encounters the next tag it
            has a simple question: "Do I give this element its own line?" For example, every
            p tag gets a new line, but a tags do not
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the key distinction between the "block" level elements (like the p tag)
            and the "inline" elements (like the a tag)
        </p>
        <table class="style-table">
            <caption>
                <p> Table: Default value for display for some of the html tags </p>
            </caption>
            <thead> <tr>
                <th id="hco1" scope="col"> Block </th>
                <th id="hco2" scope="col"> Inline </th>
            </tr> </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr> <td headers="hco1"> p </td> <td headers="hco2"> a </td> </tr>
                <tr> <td headers="hco1"> h1 </td> <td headers="hco2"> span </td> </tr>
                <tr> <td headers="hco1"> div </td> <td headers="hco2"> q </td> </tr>
                <tr> <td headers="hco1"> blockquote </td> <td headers="hco2"> i </td> </tr>
                <tr> <td headers="hco1"> ul </td> <td headers="hco2"> b </td> </tr>
                <tr> <td headers="hco1"> ol </td> <td headers="hco2"> big </td> </tr>
                <tr> <td headers="hco1"> li </td> <td headers="hco2"> small </td> </tr>

    <section>
        <p> some differences between the block - level and inline elements </p>
        <h2> Block Level </h2>
        <ul class="style-list">
            <li>
                appears below and to the left of their block level neighbors (like a
                carriage return on a typewriter going to the next new line)
            </li>
            <li> will expand to fill the width of the parent container by default </li>
            <li> respects all margin properties </li>
            <li>
                can have its width property set, which will make it narrower and cause
                its children to wrap, but not crop
            </li>
            <li>
                takes on the height of all its children (pending certain exceptions) as
                long as its own height is unset. It ignores the vertical-align property
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Inline Elements </h2>
        <ul class="style-list">
            <li>
                simply appear to the right of their preceding inline neighbor. They do not
                drop to the next line unless they must "wrap".
            </li>
            <li>
                by default, the width is simply the width of the content of the element,
                plus any padding
            </li>
            <li> ignore top and bottom margin settings </li>
            <li> ignore width and height properties </li>
            <li> are subject to vertical-align property as well as CSS white-space settings </li>
            <li>
                support padding, but any padding-top or padding-bottom does not contribute
                to the calculation of the height of the text line it sits upon
            </li>
            <li> cleave to the baseline where they are being placed </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The last bullet about inline elements is one of the most important to understand.
            Inline elements cleave to the baseline.  This is very important to understand why
            inline elements are positioned vertically the way they are. It also contributes
            to why they ignore top and bottom margins. Note that making an inline element
            "bigger" with padding will certainly keep its neighbors away horizontally. But if
            there is a neighboring text line above or below, it can only be kept at bay with
            the line-height property, not margins or padding
        </p>

        <h2> inline-block </h2>
        <p>
            Is &lt;img&gt; a block level element or inline?  If you venture to experiment
            you may conclude "both", and you will be right.
        </p>
        <p>
            For historic reasons, the img tag defaults to display:inline in most browsers.
            If you inspect using the browsers inspector, that's what you will see. However,
            it does not follow the same rules as other inline elements. In fact, regardless
            of what the inspector says, images are special cased and are inline-block.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inline-block elements still cleave to the text baseline of the line they are on.
            If top or bottom margins or paddings are used, then the entire line is adjusted
            to make room. (So the line-height does not need to be used.)
        </p>
        <ul class="style-list">
            <li> inline-block elements respect margin-top and margin-bottom </li>
            <li>
                the vertical padding for inline-block elements contributes to the calculation
                of the height of the line it falls on
            </li>
            <li> inline-block elements respect width and height properties </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In some browsers, some of the form elements default to inline-block
            (like &lt;button&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, and &lt;input&gt;)
        </p>

        <h2> display property </h2>
        <p>
            At long last we arrive at the display property. We have now seen three of its
            possible values: block, inline, and inline-block.  There are others
            (like none and flex) and we will cover them later.
