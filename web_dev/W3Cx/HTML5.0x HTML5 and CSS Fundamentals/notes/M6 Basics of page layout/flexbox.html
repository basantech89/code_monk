<article>
    <p> All the layout properties we've looked at have all applied to an individual element.  But performing layout tasks like columnar layout or anything responsive requires coordinating multiple elements.  This is where the flexbox comes in.  When working with flexbox layout, there are some CSS properties that are applied to a parent element (also known as the flex container) and other CSS properties that are applied to the direct children of that parent (also known as the flex items).  The flex container will handle laying out of its children. And, best of all, the flex container will lay out its children smartly, making the best use of the screen size available to it, while still following the general guidelines you laid down for it. As a general rule, layout with flexbox is pretty easy and the results are great. So let's get started. </p>
    <section>
        <h2> The minimum </h2>
        <p> The minimum scenario for using flexbox is to make use of two CSS rules, and better results are achieved with a third. </p>
        <ol>
            <li> display:flex; on the flex container </li>
            <li> flex:1; on the flex items (the children of the flex container) </li>
            <li> (better) flex-flow: row wrap; on the flex container. </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> flex container </h2>
        <pre>
            div  { display: flex; }
            span { display: inline-flex; }
        </pre>
        <p> To designate an element as a flex container, we simply set the display property to be flex or inline-flex. A flex element will itself be a block level element, and an inline-flex element will itself be an inline element. However, in both cases the element is now a flex container and will be handling the layout of its children. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> flex-flow </h2>
        <pre>
            .fc {
                display: flex;  /* this is now a flex container */
                flex-flow: row wrap;
            }
        </pre>
        <p> Flexbox containers can lay out their children both horizontally, as in a row, and vertically, as in a column, and both at the same time.  This means that a single flex container not only can help you lay out a three column design, but also handle the header and footer above and below. </p>
        <p> But the flexbox container does need a starting rule to follow. Do you want it to primarily line things up horizontally like a row? Or vertically like a column? And will you be wanting that row or column to wrap? The flex-flow property lets you specify both of those things. </p>
        <p> Strictly speaking, the flex-flow property is actually an abbreviation that replaces two other flexbox container properties: flex-direction and flex-wrap. </p>
        <code> flex-flow: &lt;flex-direction&gt; &lt;flex-wrap>; </code>
        <p> The possible values for the flex-direction are: row, row-reverse, column, and column-reverse. The values for the flex-wrap part are: wrap, wrap-reverse, and nowrap. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> flex items </h2>
        <p> The direct children of a flex container are automatically converted into flex items, with the exception of children that are position-fixed or position-absolute, which are taken out of the "flow" of the flex container.  So there is no property needed to designate a child as a flex item, as it happens automatically. </p>
        <p> One other automatic behavior to be aware of is that empty flex items are automatically removed from the flex container. Keep that in mind if you were planning on using an empty &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; construct as a placeholder for a CSS background image. </p>
        <p> There is an array of flex item properties that can be applied to the children of a flex container, but there are three that we are not supposed to use in isolation. These three are: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.These three properties interrelate, so rather than using them in isolation the CSS3 specification encourages us to use the flex property, which can act as an abbreviation for all the three. </p>

        <h2> flex property </h2>
        <p> flex is also the name of  a property. It is a property that is applied to flex items, the children of a flex container. </p>
        <code> span { flex: &lt;flex-grow&gt; &lt;flex-shrink&gt; &lt;flex-basis&gt;; } </code>
        <p>  The flex property also gives a flex item nice defaults for the optional properties. Therefore, flex:1; is better than flex-grow:1; . </p>

        <h3> flex-grow </h3>
        <code> p { flex: 1; /* rather than use flex-grow, use flex: &lt;flex-grow&gt; */ } </code>
        <p> The flex-grow property is set simply to a positive number. In isolation that number means nothing. However, when the flex container is laying out its children, for any row (or column) it is processing it may end up with a little extra space. The flex-grow property determines how much extra space this flex item should get relative to its siblings.  If one sibling has a flex-grow value of 2 and another  - flex-grow value of 1, the former will receive twice as much of the extra space that is divided among the children. </p>
        <p> A larger flex-grow value does not necessarily mean that an element is larger than its siblings that have smaller flex-grow values. The content of each sibling is first accounted for by the flex container when creating any row or column and only after that has been settled is any extra space distributed among the children. </p>
        <p> Setting the flex-grow to 0 will prevent the flex item from growing. But remember, that will cause the item to shed its "flexible size" super-power. </p>

        <h3> flex-shrink </h3>
        <code> p { flex: 1 1; /* rather than use flex-shrink directly, use flex: &lt;flex-grow&gt; &lt;flex-shrink&gt; */ } </code>
        <p> The flex-shrink is the opposite of flex-grow. When laying out any row or column, if the flex container needs to take away some space from the children, then those with the highest flex-shrink values contribute more of the needed space.  Again, the flex-shrink value is just a number and it only has meaning when compared to its sibling flex-shrink values. And, again, this only occurs in the situation where the flex-container might need some space from its children. </p>
        <p> Note: Like flex-grow, setting the flex-shrink to 0 will prevent the flex item from shrinking. However, this may not be as desirable as it first seems. Remember the box model from the previous section? If an item flex-shrink value is 0, then its border or padding may end up off-screen or pushed out of the parent, because there is a difference between "fitting" and "fitting nicely", and without the ability to be shrunk an item might fit but not "fit nicely". If you must set flex-shrink to 0, then it is recommended that you also set the box-sizing to border-box. </p>

        <h3> flex-basics </h3>
        <code> p { flex: 1 1 87px;  /* use flex: &lt;flex-grow&gt; &lt;flex-shrink&gt; &lt;flex-basis&gt; */} </code>
        <p> The flex-basis can be used instead of the sizing properties on a flex item. If the flex-direction of the parent flex container is row or row-reverse, then the flex-basis will govern the width of the flex item. If the flex-direction is column or column-reverse, it governs the height. </p>
        <p> The flex-basis provides the starting dimension (width or height) for the flex-item. It may be grown or shrunk from that. If you do not want it to change at all, then set the flex-grow and flex-shrink to 0, and the box-sizing to border-box.  However, this is not advisable. Read the flex-shrink discussion above. </p>
