    <p> Like the other positioning properties, z-index only applies to positioned elements (elements that have their position property set to relative, absolute,or fixed, but not static).  With the z-index you can control overlapping - whether or not an element is in front of or behind other sibling positioned elements.  The z-index can be an integer 0 or higher. The higher the number, the more "topmost" or "overlapping" the element will be. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> z-index has no effect on position:static (the default) elements. </li>
        <li> If z-index is not set, siblings that appear later in the HTML document overlap (are "higher than") earlier siblings. </li>
        <li> z-index is relative between siblings, not any arbitrary elements. </li>
    </ul>

        <h2> Siblings and nesting </h2>
        <p> It is entirely possible that one element with z-index:100 could appear below another element with z-index:1 </p>
        <p> This can happen because the z-index is used to figure out which sibling is higher than another. But if two elements are not siblings, then the z-index of their respective sibling ancestors will need to be calculated to figure out which is higher. </p>
        <p> Below is a simple example: there are two overlapping sibling divs, "Albert" and "Betty". Albert has a red border and is  z-index:1.  Betty has a blue border, and is z-index:2.  Therefore, Betty and her child Bernice are higher than Albert and his child Alan. Albert's child Alan has a z-index of 100, which is the highest z-index of any of them, but because Alan's parent Albert is lower than Betty, Alan remains behind. Alan's high z-index is only relevant to his siblings, not to cousins further out in the document. </p>
