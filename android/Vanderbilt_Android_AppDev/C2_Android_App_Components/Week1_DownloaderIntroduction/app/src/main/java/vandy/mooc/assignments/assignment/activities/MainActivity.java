/**
 * This is the main activity class for the application and will be created and
 * be displayed when the application is first started. It extends the base class
 * MainActivityBase which supports add and download FABs and a fragment that
 * contains a RecyclerView that manages a list of strings. This base class also
 * manages all configuration changes and also saving and restoring the displayed
 * list of strings between application sessions.
 * <p/>
 * In addition to managing the string list, the base class expects this sub
 * class to handle creating intents that are used to start a GalleryActivity. In
 * some assignments, there will also be a requirement to have the
 * GalleryActivity return a result intent back to the MainActivity so that the
 * two activities can keep the displayed lists in sync.
