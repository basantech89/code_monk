/**
 * IGNORE THIS CLASS.
 * <p>
 * This class exists to assist in the auto-grading framework that we have
 * developed.
 * Knowledge of this class and how it works will not be required in this
 * course at all.
 * <p>
 * You will need to set this up properly. There are 3 test files
 * required for auto-grading.
 * 1. EspressoBase (has useful common Espresso helper methods used by all
 * tests).
 * 2. MainActivityTest (MainActivity tests using a local resource URL)
 * 3. DownloadActivityTest (DownloadActivity tests using a local resource URL)
 * <p>
 * The test directory also contains a FullWebApplicationTest file that does not
 * need to be included with the grader because it tests the application using
 * a REMOTE image URL. It exists only for students to run and test their
 * application by downloading a REMOTE image URL and therefore the tests in
 * this file assume the existence of an active internet connection.
