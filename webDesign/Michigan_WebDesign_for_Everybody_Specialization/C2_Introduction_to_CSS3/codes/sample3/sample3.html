00:00:01,220lem.

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,200
So that could be 2^n.

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,040
And keep in mind that n^2 grows in a very different manner than 2^n,

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,450
as we change n.

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,560
And in fact, this sequence is really listed in roughly the order of

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,530
increasing complexity.

30
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,900
Each one of these classes describes a slightly more

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,990
complex kind of algorithm.

32
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,070
And as a consequence, we tend to want to be as high up in

33
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,770
this chain as we can.

34
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,690
If I have two algorithms that solve the same problem, one of them is

35
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,150
quadratic, the other one is linear, I want the linear one because it&#39;s

36
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,190
almost certainly goin

And what am I going to do?

217
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,420
I&#39;m going to loop over every element in L2, or almost every element in L2,

218
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,330
looking to see if I find one that&#39;s equal to e1.

219
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,420
If I find something that&#39;s equal, I set the flag to True and

		<div><p>multiple loops, we&, all the way down to 2^0.

375
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,130
Now we can actually solve this, but a little bit of math actually tells me

376
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,580
that that sum, 2^0 + 2^
